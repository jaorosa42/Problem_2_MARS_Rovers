First thing to do is select the insertion mode (file or console)
If the file mode is selected, the file must be the following format.

Example:

5 5
1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
3 3 E
MMRMMRMRR

The first line of input is the upper-right coordinates of the plateau.
The rest of the lines is the rover's initial position and rover's movement.
The user must paste the file path.

In console mode, the user will insert manually.

Than, the software prints the final position of each rover on plateau.

The program prints every single moment a rover goes out of the plateau.
